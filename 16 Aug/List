Solved A, B

C : was simple Dijkstra with reverse edge added, but not able to prove its correctness.

D : Nice Dp problem in grid

## Correctness for C,

constraint : from each node, we can reverse an incoming edge atmost once.

Fact : if we have +ve weight in a graph then atmost once each node will be visited.
no node will be visited twice.

For D:

what if we don't have contraints of teleportation ?
dp[i][j] = minimum cost to reach (n-1,m-1) if we start from i,j;

changes for actual problem will be
dp[i][j][moves] = minimum cost to reach (n-1, m-1) if we start from (i,j) and used 'moves' times teleportation.
